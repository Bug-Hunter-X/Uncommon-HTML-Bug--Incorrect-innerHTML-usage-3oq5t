This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to manipulating the innerHTML property. The bug arises from attempting to modify the innerHTML of an element before the browser has finished parsing the HTML. This can sometimes lead to the initial content of the element not being displayed, or only being displayed after a delay. The solution demonstrates how to use DOMContentLoaded event to ensure that the HTML is fully parsed before attempting to manipulate it.
